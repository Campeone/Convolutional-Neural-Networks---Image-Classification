### Convolutional-Neural-Networks - Image-Classification 
This repository containing CNN - Image classification projects was implemented by me. 
It was programmed in Google colaboratory (a cloud-based data analysis and machine learning tool 
that allows you to combine executable Python code and rich text along with charts, images, HTML, 
LaTeX and more into a single document stored in Google Drive.)

**Convolutional Neural Network, also known as convnets or CNN**, is a well-known method in computer vision applications. 
It is a class of deep neural networks that are used to analyze visual imagery. 

This type of architecture is dominant to recognize objects from a picture or video. 
It is used in applications like image or video recognition, neural language processing, etc. 

For example Facebook uses CNN for automatic tagging algorithms, 
Amazon — for generating product recommendations and 
Google — for search through among users’ photos.

In this repository, we have used CNN to classify Emergency from Non Emergency Vehicles, 
Detect and classify blood cell images with malaria parasites, and classify flowers into 5 
different classes. 

The dataset used in this repository was gotten from KAGGLE and TENSORFLOW
[Emergency from Non Emergency Vehicles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kishor1210/emergency-vs-nonemergency-vehicle-classification), 
[Malaria Cell Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria), 
[Flower photos](http://download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz).
